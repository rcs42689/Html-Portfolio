<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Growing up in Southwest Washington State and Northern Minnesota I have a love of nature and outdoor activities.
   I have a passion for travelling and frequent the Carribean Isles as often as I can.
   My passion for technology developed a little later than most but Coding and Web Development has piqued my interest as of late.
</p>

<p>I love learning all the aspects that go into the creation of the websites we all enjoy. 
  I have many types of hobbies and learning is by far my favorite. A creative by nature.
  I am always creating something from cross stitch projects, leatherworking to coding.
   I am always doing something to make something awesome.
   I enjoy my quiet and if I'm not travelling you can find me enjoying the comforts of home. </p>
